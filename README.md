# Responsive Web Design Patterns

This repository stores examples that allow identifying how various CSS design patterns are constructed. Below is a brief description of the included patterns:

## CSS Grid
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows creating complex layouts easily. It uses a grid of rows and columns to organize content.

## Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that facilitates the alignment and distribution of elements within a container. It is ideal for creating flexible and responsive layouts.

## Sidebar
The Sidebar pattern refers to a side panel that contains navigation or other secondary content. It is common in web applications and content-heavy sites.

## Layout Shifter
Layout Shifter is a pattern that adapts the page layout according to the screen size. It allows content to reorganize to provide a better experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Tiny Tweaks
Tiny Tweaks are small adjustments made to the design to improve usability and appearance. These can include changes in spacing, colors, typography, among others.

## Mostly Fluid
Mostly Fluid is a design pattern that uses fluid units (like percentages) for most elements, allowing the layout to adapt to different screen sizes, while some elements may have fixed sizes.

This repository is a collection of practical examples that illustrate how these design patterns are constructed.
